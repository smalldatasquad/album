# Capture Your Facebook Posts


Small Data Squad invites you to take a 'screenshot' of your facebook data by scraping your posts.


# setup

Open up an app called 'Terminal' and paste these commands in line by line, pressing 'enter' after each one.
If you're asked for a password, enter the password you use to unlock your computer.
```
cd Desktop
sudo easy_install pip
git clone https://github.com/smalldatasquad/capture_facebook.git
cd capture_facebook
pip install --upgrade pip
brew install chromedriver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Secrets
If you have Atom, type `Atom .` in the terminal.

If not, launch a text editor and open the folder we just created called 'capture_facebook'.

Duplicate the file called secrets.py.example amd rename the copy to "secrets.py".
Inside secrets.py, fill in the variables with your information and save.

# Run
To run the file, open Terminal and enter this line.
```
python run.py
```

# ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘» Navigate to Chrome and watch as your facebook posts scroll by ðŸ‘» ðŸ‘€.
